# Example songs for Polytone

## \*.mon

All of the .mon files come from the [MONOTONE repository](https://github.com/MobyGamer/MONOTONE).

## example.pol

An incomplete re-creation of a tune by Wojciech Wojtkiewicz for the Commodore 64. I first discovered it in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hUPZAtkyEA).

Originally used for testing the new features of Polytone (specifically, the higher range of arpeggio).

The original SID file can be found in the [HVSC](https://www.hvsc.c64.org/), under `/MUSICIANS/T/Tracker/Tracker_01.sid`.

## tdu.pol

A conversion of some song I heard in a DOS cracktro.
Don't know its name, but I found it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyyAobq59n4) under the title "intro number 33".

This song definitely highlights the issue of the lack of volume control in Polytone. It is barely possible to even hear the lead melody (on channel 2).
